# If it isn't possible to find out the correct mail domain name of
# your system in /etc/mailname, by reading sendmail.cf, /etc/hostname
# or /etc/HOSTNAME, you can specify it in the variable
# MAIL_DOMAIN_NAME. This overrides all other mechanisms.
#

# - m_muttalias      query set of mutt alias files:
#
# Set MUTTALIAS_FILES below to list of files in MUTT_DIRECTORY that
# contain mutt aliases. File names without leading slash will have
# $MUTT_DIRECTORY (defaults to $HOME/.mutt or $HOME, if ~/.mutt does
# not exist) prepended before the file name. Absolute file names
# (beginning with /) will be taken direct.

# If you want to use private modules set the MODULES_PATH to find them:
# (a space separated list):

# MODULES_PATH="/sw/lib/lbdb"


#
# Do you want the output to be sorted?
# If you set this to "false" or "no", lbdbq won't sort the addresses
# but returns them in reverse order (which means that the most recent
# address in m_inmail database is first).
# If you set this to "name", lbdbq sorts the output by real name.
# If you set this to "comment", lbdbq sorts the output by comment (column 3).
# If you set this to "address", lbdbq sorts the output by addresses
# (that's the default).
#
SORT_OUTPUT=name

#
# Do you want to see duplicate mail addresses (with multiple real
# names or different comment fields)?  Default is "no".
