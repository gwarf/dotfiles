# NeoMutt config file for the forgotten-attachment feature.

# The 'forgotten-attachment' feature provides a new setting for NeoMutt that
# alerts the user if the message body contains a certain regular expression but there are
# no attachments added. This is meant to ensure that the user does not forget
# to attach a file after promising to do so in the mail.

# Ask if the user wishes to abort sending if $attach_keyword is found in the
# body, but no attachments have been added
set abort_noattach = ask-yes

# Search for the following regular expression in the body of the email
# Français and English
# set attach_keyword = "\\<(attaché|attachés|attach|attache|attached|attachments?|attachons|joint|jointe|joints|jointes|joins|joignons)\\>"
